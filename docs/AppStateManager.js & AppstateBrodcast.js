# JS AppState Management Setup

#### ChatGPT:
To create a robust JavaScript setup with `AppStateManager.js` and `AppStateBroadcast.js`, we'll design these files to work closely with the existing structure and utility methods defined in your knowledge. The goal is to gather and manage application state comprehensively and enable broadcasting of this state along with methods, objects, and properties from classes like `NavBarBuilder.js` and `Controller.js`. This setup will ensure a cohesive state management system that can handle user interactions, history changes, and dynamic content loading effectively.

### AppStateManager.js

`AppStateManager.js` will act as the central hub for gathering and managing the application's state. This includes tracking navbar interactions, history object states, and dynamically loaded HTML templates. It will use utility methods like `fs` for DOM manipulation and other utility methods as needed.

```javascript
import Utility from './Utility.js';
import { NavBarBuilder } from './NavBarBuilder.js';
import { Controller } from './Controller.js';

class AppStateManager {
    constructor() {
        this.utility = new Utility();
        this.navBarBuilder = new NavBarBuilder();
        this.controller = new Controller(this.utility);
        this.state = {
            navbarClicks: [],
            historyPaths: [],
            loadedTemplates: []
        };
    }

    // Track Navbar Clicks
    trackNavbarClicks() {
        const navbarLinks = this.utility.fs('nav a'); // Assuming 'nav a' selects all anchor tags in the navbar
        navbarLinks.forEach(link => {
            link.addEventListener('click', event => {
                this.state.navbarClicks.push(event.target.href);
                // Additional logic to handle the click event
            });
        });
    }

    // Update History State
    updateHistoryState(path) {
        this.state.historyPaths.push(path);
        history.pushState({ path }, '', path);
        // Additional logic to handle history state updates
    }

    // Load HTML Template
    async loadHtmlTemplate(url, targetElementId) {
        await this.utility.loadHtmlTemplate(url, targetElementId);
        this.state.loadedTemplates.push(url);
        // Additional logic after loading the template
    }

    // Getter to access the current state
    getState() {
        return this.state;
    }
}

export default AppStateManager;
```

### AppStateBroadcast.js

`AppStateBroadcast.js` will be responsible for broadcasting the application state and making methods, objects, and properties from classes like `NavBarBuilder` and `Controller` available for invocation. This could involve event-driven communication or a publish-subscribe pattern to efficiently propagate changes and updates throughout the application.

```javascript
import AppStateManager from './AppStateManager.js';

class AppStateBroadcast {
    constructor(appStateManager) {
        this.appStateManager = appStateManager;
        // Initialize any required listeners or subscribers
    }

    // Method to broadcast current state
    broadcastState() {
        const currentState = this.appStateManager.getState();
        // Logic to broadcast the state to subscribers or through events
    }

    // Method to make NavBarBuilder and Controller methods available
    exposeMethods() {
        // Logic to expose methods from NavBarBuilder and Controller
        // This could involve creating a unified interface or API that other parts of the application can interact with
    }
}

export default AppStateBroadcast;
```

### Integration

Integrate `AppStateManager` and `AppStateBroadcast` with the existing application setup:

1. Instantiate `AppStateManager` in your main application file (e.g., `Main.js`) and start tracking the necessary state.
2. Use `AppStateBroadcast` to expose and broadcast state and methods as needed across the application.
3. Ensure that `NavBarBuilder`, `Controller`, and other relevant classes are integrated to work seamlessly with this state management and broadcasting setup.

This approach provides a structured way to manage and broadcast the application state, ensuring that components like the navbar, dynamic content loaders, and history management are all cohesively managed.
